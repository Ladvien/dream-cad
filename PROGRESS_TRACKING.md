# Download Progress Tracking Implementation

## Problem Solved

Users were experiencing "hung" TUI when downloading models because there was no feedback during the 1-5GB downloads. The TUI would appear frozen for 5-15 minutes while models downloaded in the background.

## Solution Implemented

Added comprehensive download progress tracking that shows:
- ðŸ“¥ Download start message with model name and size
- ðŸ“Š Real-time progress percentage
- Download speed in MB/s
- Time remaining (ETA)
- âœ… Completion message

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `download_utils.py`
- `download_with_progress()` - Main download function with progress tracking
- `format_time()` - Formats seconds into human-readable time (e.g., "2m 45s")
- `check_disk_space()` - Verifies sufficient disk space before download
- `get_download_size()` - Gets repository size from HuggingFace

### 2. Updated All Model Downloads
- **TripoSR** - Shows progress for ~1.5GB download
- **Stable-Fast-3D** - Shows progress for ~2.5GB download  
- **TRELLIS** - Shows progress for ~4.5GB download
- **Hunyuan3D** - Shows progress for ~4.5GB download

### 3. Enhanced TUI Integration
- Progress callbacks passed through ModelConfig
- Real-time updates in TUI log area
- Thread-safe progress updates
- No UI freezing during downloads

## User Experience

### Before
```
[yellow]Loading TripoSR model...[/yellow]
[dim]First time use will download the model (1-5GB).[/dim]
[dim]This is a one-time download that will be cached.[/dim]
[... silence for 10+ minutes ...]
```

### After
```
[yellow]Loading TripoSR model...[/yellow]
[cyan]ðŸ“¥ Starting download of TripoSR (1.5GB)[/cyan]
[cyan]This is a one-time download that will be cached.[/cyan]
[cyan]ðŸ“Š Progress: 15.2% (228MB / 1.5GB) - 45.3 MB/s - ETA: 29s[/cyan]
[cyan]ðŸ“Š Progress: 35.8% (537MB / 1.5GB) - 52.1 MB/s - ETA: 19s[/cyan]
[cyan]ðŸ“Š Progress: 67.4% (1.01GB / 1.5GB) - 48.7 MB/s - ETA: 10s[/cyan]
[cyan]ðŸ“Š Progress: 89.2% (1.34GB / 1.5GB) - 46.2 MB/s - ETA: 3s[/cyan]
[cyan]ðŸ“Š Progress: 100.0% (1.5GB / 1.5GB) - 44.8 MB/s - ETA: 0s[/cyan]
[cyan]âœ… TripoSR downloaded successfully![/cyan]
```

## Technical Details

### Progress Callback System
1. TUI creates a progress callback function
2. Callback is passed through ModelConfig to model
3. Model's `_download_model()` uses callback for updates
4. Updates are thread-safe using `call_from_thread()`

### Download Features
- **Resume Support**: Downloads can be resumed if interrupted
- **Disk Space Check**: Prevents failed downloads due to insufficient space
- **Fallback Repositories**: TRELLIS tries alternative repo if primary fails
- **Cache Detection**: Skips download if model already cached

## Benefits

1. **User Confidence**: Users know the system is working, not frozen
2. **Time Estimates**: Users can plan around download completion
3. **Transparency**: Users see exactly what's happening
4. **Professional**: Matches expectations from modern applications
5. **Debugging**: Easier to diagnose slow downloads or network issues

## Testing

Run the test script to see progress formatting:
```bash
poetry run python test_progress.py
```

Run the TUI to see real downloads with progress:
```bash
poetry run python dreamcad_tui_new.py
```

## Future Enhancements

- Add pause/resume buttons in TUI
- Show total download size before starting
- Add network speed test before download
- Cache download statistics for better ETAs
- Add download queue for multiple models
