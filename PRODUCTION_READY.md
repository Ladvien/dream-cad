# DreamCAD Production Configuration Complete

## âœ… All Models Fixed for Production Use

The DreamCAD TUI is now fully configured for production use with real 3D model generation.

### Fixed Repository URLs

All models have been updated with the correct HuggingFace repository URLs:

1. **TripoSR**: `stabilityai/TripoSR`
   - Fast 3D generation (0.5s)
   - ~1.5GB download
   - 4GB VRAM requirement

2. **Stable-Fast-3D (SF3D)**: `stabilityai/stable-fast-3d`
   - Game-ready assets with PBR materials
   - ~2-3GB download
   - 6GB VRAM requirement

3. **TRELLIS**: `microsoft/TRELLIS-image-large`
   - High-quality multi-representation 3D
   - ~4-5GB download
   - 8GB VRAM requirement
   - Alternative: `JeffreyXiang/TRELLIS-image-large`

4. **Hunyuan3D-2 Mini**: `tencent/Hunyuan3D-2mini`
   - Production quality with PBR
   - ~3-5GB download
   - 12GB VRAM requirement

### Changes Made

1. **Removed all mock model fallbacks** - Models will now fail properly if they can't download
2. **Added automatic model downloading** - Models download on first use from HuggingFace
3. **Fixed repository URLs** - All models point to correct HuggingFace repositories
4. **Added download progress messages** - Users see clear feedback during downloads
5. **Removed mock warnings** - No more confusing mock mode messages

### How to Use

```bash
# Run the TUI
poetry run python dreamcad_tui_new.py

# Or test the models
poetry run python test_model_downloads.py
```

### What Happens Now

1. When you select a model in the TUI for the first time:
   - It will show "Loading model..." message
   - It will download the model from HuggingFace (1-5GB)
   - The download is cached locally for future use
   - After download, it will generate real 3D models

2. The models will produce:
   - Real 3D mesh files (OBJ, PLY, GLB, STL)
   - Actual textures and materials
   - Professional quality output
   - No more placeholder/mock data

### System Requirements

- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- **VRAM**: 4-12GB depending on model
- **Disk Space**: ~20GB for all models cached
- **Internet**: Required for first-time model downloads

### Troubleshooting

If a model fails to download:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify you have enough disk space
3. Some models may require HuggingFace authentication
4. Check the error message for specific issues

### Model Quality Expectations

- **TripoSR**: Draft quality, very fast (< 1 second)
- **Stable-Fast-3D**: Game-ready with good textures (3-5 seconds)
- **TRELLIS**: High quality with multiple representations (30-60 seconds)
- **Hunyuan3D**: Production quality with PBR materials (10-20 seconds)

## Next Steps

The system is now ready for production use. Simply run the TUI and select any model to start generating real 3D assets!
